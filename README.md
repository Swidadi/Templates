# Templates
My personal Guild Wars builds for on-the-go use. 

Create an empty folder named "Guild Wars" in your Documents folder, and clone the repo there. 
Guild Wars will automatically be able to read Guild Wars/Templates/Skills and doesn't mind that there is a .git sitting in the Templates.
Or, if you wish to sync more often:
git init in your local saves folder in Guild Wars/Templates/Skills
git 

When running on Linux using Steam/Proton, you can find your save files in: 
> /Steam/steamapps/compatdata/29720/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Guild Wars/Templates

Most, if not all, of them are shameless variations of meta GWPvX builds. Feel free to use them nonetheless, or take inspiration from this GitHub set-up and create your own!
