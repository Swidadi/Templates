# Templates
My personal Guild Wars builds for on-the-go use. 

Create an empty folder named "Guild Wars" in your Documents folder, and clone the repo there. 
Guild Wars will automatically be able to read Guild Wars/Templates/Skills.

When running on Linux using Steam/Proton, you can find your save files in:
